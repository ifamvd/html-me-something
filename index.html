    <h1>My Favorite St. Louis Eateries</h1>
    <p>
        There are so many different places here in St. Louis where you can grab
        delicious food to eat. Here are some of my favorites. And rather than
        believing my words, you can read below what others have said about these
        places. <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> They are not in any particular orders.
        I like them equally depending on how I feel. BBQ joints happened to be on
        top because I was craving BBQ when I was working on this.

        Excellent smoked meats, hard to choose just one!  Their sides are fresh and
        great quality, with my favorite restaurant version of baked beans.  They often
        have unique specials too (my husband tried one that had rib cakes as a bun)!
        They usually have dessert options by the cashier as well, courtesy of their
        nearby pie shop.  I recommend their signature Sugarfire Pie!
    </p>
    <p>
        I love BBQ and when I am in a place that is known for it I make it a point to
        seek out some smoked meat! Sugarfire is a counter style eat in or take out
        place. We got the baby back ribs and the brisket with a variety of sides,
        everything was perfectly  cooked and tasty even without sauces. I am a huge
        brisket fan, Sugarfire's was juicy and tender, my mouth  is watering just
        thinking about it. The staff was knowledgeable, friendly, and eager to serve.

        This place was awesome! The food was perfect. The soda fountain was not the
        "big boys" as i think it was much better! The service was beyond helpful and
        did i mention the food? OMG! Will be back again for sure. More of the BBQ
        beans, more brisket, more scalloped potatoes. Can't go wrong here!

        UNBELIEVABLE ribs! I’m a bit skeptical whenever anyone claims having the #1
        anything. Well, I’ve had ribs in 3 different continents at several restaurants
        and have to say their ribs win #1 in my list! Service was amazingly fast. You
        sit and suddenly their bringing your order. Prices are greatly affordable $30
        for two without drinks half slab and brisket with two sides.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you don't go to Pappy's when visiting, you're not visiting the Lou right.
        If you don't eat here and you live in STL, are you even living? Pappy's is,
        hands down, second to none, hometown BBQ that no one could ever hate. It
        doesn't matter what meat you order, because it's going to taste good. The
        beans? Yeah, they've got pork in em. The potato salad and slaw can't be beat.
        Get out here and eat
    </p>
    <p>
        You must try this. Amazing food and sauce. Very efficient almost cafeteria
        style ordering. Worth every penny. You probably won't be there for more than
        an hour including eating.

        I always enjoy the food and especially the bubble tea here. I find myself
        coming back here often. Definitely recommending this place if you enjoy good
        Chinese food and bubble tea.
    </p>
    <p>
        Their noodles are absolutely delicious. I got the hand pulled stir fried
        noodles with shrimp and they were amazing. Also, if you are looking for
        something sweet, I highly recommend their fluffy ice. They have in a couple
        of different flavors. It's so light and refreshing, especially on these hot,
        summer days. Their bubble is also incredibly delicious as well. The food is
        always good everytime I go there.
    </p>
    <p>
        Super yummy! The veggie delight is my favorite dish and the portion was
        sufficient to fill me up. The food is flavorful and the ambient here is
        comfortable and chill. I am studying at WashU for the summer so it's also
        conveniently located next to the university.

        I had been craving uighur, northern chinese lamb dishes and I definitely got
        my fill here. Delish!!! The gentlemen who served me was fantastic. I will
        definitely be going back.
    </p>
    <p>
        Soooo Yummy. We had the pork lung appetizer with white rice, the lamb chili
        pot, beef fried rice and the pork liver with vegetables. Everything was
        delicious and the portions were huge. HUGE! I brought home 2 boxes and a
        bucket. I made 2 meals out of it already and there is still more. The
        flavors and textures are amazing. Great customer service. Will recommend
        and will return.

        Our family went to visit Washington University at St. Louis in the summer.
        We found this small restaurant by accident and decided to give it a try.
        We are from Cleveland and like to sample Chinese food in the big cities.
        I cook Chinese food well at home and am usually picky about the qualities
        of  Chinese food served in Chinatowns. I have to admit  Yummy 17 serves
        genuine Chinese food! Their dumplings are among the best I have ever had.
        Great taste, great price, great service! Look forward going there next time
        in town. One thing I don't understand is why they don't accept tips.
    </p>

        I love Saint Louis bubble tea! This place is awesome the service is great
        the workers work there for their entire lives they love it so much. The drinks
        are amazing you won't find anything like it anywhere else around here and the
        food is really good they serve traditionally St Louis style Chinese food. The
        food is always delicious and they serve it with a smile. They have no issues
        with preparing your dish or drink to your specifications. It's a great place
        to meet with friends you can have a meal and a drink without spending a lot
        of money. And you're right there in the Delmar Loop but lots of other
        interesting and fun places await you!

        Best fried dumplings ever. The milk teas are fantastic! The staff has always
        been friendly and helpful! Thank you!

    <p>
        First time doing Korean BBQ. The staff are really great, they trade out the
        grills so it doesn't get so burnt. I don't suggest the all you can eat for less
        than 4. We only got through 3 of the meat. If you are going for two, ask for
        half portions. If you ever get confused ask, they are really chill staff. You
        could do glutton and grain free here too, it is possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Professional and extremely delicious entrees.  Decided to try the all you can eat
        grill for my first time there.  You get to cook your own food on a small electric
        grill positioned in the middle of the table.  I normally go for top items first
        to get the best experience.  Not at all disappointed with the results.  Several
        side dishes including kimchi and plates of tender, marinated chicken and beef.
        Seating was comfortable and not much of a wait.  For the younger crowd, if your
        nights just getting started, Pink Galleon is right next door.
    </p>
    <p>
        Absolutely amazing! First timer- the staff got so busy, yet they exercised patience
        and kindness in explaining between bbq'ing and just regular dine in. I'm absolutely
        happy and will be back more often. Thank you for amazing service in the middle of
        chaos!

    <p>
        I have eaten here as well as ordered from here multiple times. It has never
        disappointed me. The food is great both quality-wise and quantity-wise. I especially
        like the chicken that they serve along with the ramen. Very well cooked and
        delicious. Service is good too.
    </p>
    <p>
        Amazing place from the start! Was greeted as soon as I walked in, and all of my
        questions were answered before I decided what to order. I haven't had a lot of
        experiences with Ramen before, so I was pretty excited to try it out. All of the
        food we ordered was delicious, and I'm so glad we decided to come here for lunch!!
        Will definitely be back again soon
    </p>
    <p>
        Amazing Ramen!! Please come in and try! I went about a month ago - yes, they do have
        a veggie ramen bowl (that you can customize to be vegan) I love the atmosphere of
        this place! :)

        This spot is a real gem on Olive!  Food is creative, fresh, and very flavorful.
        There are specials every day (which are sometimes really unique!) that are well worth
        trying.  The place has an energetic vibe and the staff are extremely friendly.
        They do take-out as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a huge fan of Mai Lee, so it's no surprise that I love this place which is a
        spin-off of Mai Lee focused on just pho and ramen. The broths are incredibly flavorful
        and filled with the freshest vegetables. The menu is quite small, but there are no bad
        options; they also have specials all the time if you want to try an often-unique
        creation. The service is very quick making Nudo House a perfect place to go for a
        lunch break. Well-deserved 5 stars!
    </p>

        Had the tamarind fried chicken von mi was so awesome. Everything is always so good and
        taste are fresh and vibrant. Keep up the Great Work!
